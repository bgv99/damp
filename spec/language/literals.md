### Literals
A literal is simply the value of something, such as a variable. There are different kinds of literals; character, string, integer, boolean, floating point and pointer literals.

| Kind      | Literal value/values |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Boolean   | `true`, `false`      |
| Character | `' '`                |
| String    | `" "`                |
| Pointer   | `null`               |
| Integer   | `123`, `-123`        |
| Floating  | `1.23`               |

## Reserved literals
- `true`
- `false`
- `null`

## Notes
- A character literal must represent one character. `'abc'` will not be a valid example.
- `"` is used with string literals and `'` is used with character literals.
